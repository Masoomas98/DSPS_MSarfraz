For this homework I felt so better because i was working alone for the most of the part, but i did take help from Willow for normalizing stuff, discussed some tsne plots with Paula and Zach.

This homework was about 3 different clustering methods, namely KMEANS, DBSCAN and AGGLOMERATIVE HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING. We were given a dataset of renal cancer patients with 4224 genes and 74 features ( patients ) so basically, with the information given, we had to cluster the genes and look for optimal number of clusters using each clustering method by plotting TSNE and UMAP projection. KMEANS is a good clustering method for well-defined, structured dataset because we have to define cluster numbers oursleves, DBSCAN is extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, so I would say it wasn't the best choice for clustering the genes data we had. On the other hand Agglomerative clustering using the visuals of dendogram seemed the most reasonable clustering method for this specific dataset. 

The most difficult pasrt of the homework was how to interpret the tsne and umap plots, what do they tells any useful information?

The easy part this time was coding! Fed's slides helped alot it was easy coding thanks to scipy packages and sklearn.

It was a fun assignment and I learned how to use different clustering methods, what arguments are important for each method, the importance of choosing right hyperparameters.
