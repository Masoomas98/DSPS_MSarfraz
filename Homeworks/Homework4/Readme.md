For this current homework I worked with Sarah throughout and had discussion with Tali regarding question 2 and plotting the final curves with errors, then I got stucked in vratio function where Paula helped me a lot. Other than these three people I had just overall discussion with Bivek and Zach.

This homework had 3 parts, number 1 to derive the relation between velocity and distance in Newtonian dynamics,
Part 2 was to test the significance of dark matter using the relation of velocity and distance from the center of the galaxy and hope to get the same observation as predicted by Newtonian dynamics, However when after data wrangling and applying the cuts we plotted the data we learned that the observed data in not in agreement with the expected one. One possible reason of flat rotation curves is that there is hidden matter present when we move radially outward away from the galactic center. So we worked on this taking into account the uncertainities.
Part 3 was a question from the paper of MCMC sampling which asked us to use the knowledge of bayesian theorem and read the algorithm to do MCMC sampling for a target distribution and see if the result overlap.

The hardest part for me was from vratio function onwards, I was totally clueless how to proceed with the errors and find the ratio of which radii and vellocities.

The easiest part , this time was to get raw data, data wrangling and do the broadcasting part to plot the curves. It was actually a fun project tho I still have some problems in between where I discussed some parts with the people I worked with.

I learned a bit to play with uncertainities and how to include them in your statistical analysis, I am still looking forward to work more and polish my skills for data analysis.
