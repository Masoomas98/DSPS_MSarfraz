For this homework I worked alone while taking help from Fed's video, I did have some discussion with Miles for neural network costruction and Sarah for plots and figures understanding.

The homework was about Physics Informed Neural Networks, as NNs cannot understand Physics behind the task. Can we understand the structure in the data? so we can learn the physics behind the data, or the pattern. We used the NN to solve non-linear partial differential equations, specifically by Burger's equations used for shock. Part of this equation depends on time and other on space and they are linked together in differential space. The equation is a special case with zero viscosity. The non-linear differential equations are difficult to solve. The idea was predict the Burger's solution using neural network and compare with the true solutions to see how well the neural network performs. And see if the NN can solve when feeded with initial and boundary conditions.

The difficult part for me was to understand the problem and think about how neural network will work tho it was super simplified with the help in the ocde given already.

The easy part for me was to run the model and look at the loss funvtions to see how well or bad it's performing. 

The new thing I learned is about Burger's equation, and how neural network can work with physics problems.
