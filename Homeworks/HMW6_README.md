For this homework I worked alone, it was about finding a plot that is visually bad following  three points, and a good plot that follows some of the tufts rules. And then finding a bad plot we made and correcting it.

**PART A**

**Visually Bad Plot**

The plot is somewhat misleading hence distorted as the caption mention 4 processes but the labels are only for 3 process, that too not defined properly which curve presents which process. There is no key for the symbols they have used for example sterics or triangles represent what? What is the grey color plot presenting? So there is distortion and ambiguity as ecuase of same tones of black and gre the error bars are messed up above 1GeV and it could lead to confusion among the readers, One way t oplot these could be to use subplots and explain all 4 processes separately for the cross sections or atleast use different distinct colors or some transparency to see what's hidden underneath the overlapping plots.

**Visually Good Plot**

This plot caught my attention as it was extremely easy to understand. According to Tufte's rules
