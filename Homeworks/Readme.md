For homework I worked with Miles and Sarah, and discussed one part of the homework with Zach. 
Willow helped a lot in understanding the gaussian fit part of central limit theorem.

The homework has two parts:
  1- Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in which first of all we worked with labelling the plots, then finding the relation of scale factor as a function of temperature.
   - Then finding the mean of chi distribution with different scale factor values and comparing those with the mean of emperical distribution.
  2- Central limit theorem, In this we had 5 distributions , chi-square, poisson, normal, binomial and cauchy, which were meant to prove the theorem that is as the sample size approaches the population size
     then the mean of those sample distributions also approaches the population mean.

     
The hardest part for me was to understand what the questions were asking for in Central limit theorem, it took me a while to figure out dictionaries but I preferred to stick with arrays later on.
And fitting the gaussian curve which I tried multiple ways with the given function, then failed and switched to stats.norm.pdf which was quite simple.


The easiest part was to make distributions and find the mean so homework on MBoltzmann was easy.

I leaened multiple things, no.1 how normalization works (Density= True) matters!, scipy.stats.norm.pdf, how to do curve fit using scipy however I am still struggling with scipy.curve_fit.
