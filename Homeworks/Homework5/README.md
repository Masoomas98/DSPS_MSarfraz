For this homework I worked with Zach, Miles, and Sarah, and had a little discussion over different sections with Shar, Paula, Tali and Rayta. 

This homework was about fiting the best model to a GRB after glow data with different techniques, Using linear regression and broken power law models. The fits were made using minimizing the L1 and L2 , chisquared loss functions, using machin elearning techniques specifically sklearn fit method. In order to find the best paramteres fit, Bayes theorem techniques were used where we had to define prior, posterior and likelihood, for both models and finding the the best model using likelihood ratio test and the aic, bic criteria. 

The easy part of this homework was from the start until task 2 where we just plot and visualize the data and then using the given codes we just plot the fits and corner plots and interpret the data. 

The hard part was mostly to define the bayes theorem's variables in a slightly modified way, i was messing up the signs a lot.

The new thing that i learned: I usually do have some confusion when i just look at the slides, but these homeworks makes the concepts clear and it's more easy to uderstand what to do and how to do. So i learned to interpret the corner plots and how to do understand the analysis for AIC and BIC to see which model fits the best.
