-Hello my name is Masooma Sarfraz, I'm a second year grad student working on pulse extraction and data analysis with Machine learning techniques. Excited to learn the basics and advanced topics on data analysis.

1- I decided to take this class as I need to learn these techniques required for my research work, which time sensitive pulse extraction and analysis.
2- I hope to learn various Machine learning techniques, how does this work and improve my programming skills.
3- As I am already working with python and understanding machine learning hopefully it will help me with this course, moreover working as a team will help me interact and learn from my course fellows as well.
